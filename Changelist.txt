Changes from 0.2.3 to 0.2.4 release:
- recipe adjustment for clockwork rifle bot if Bob's electronics is enabled (thanks Nexela!)
- changed codebase to add new squads to a tick-update list, and each tick in a 60 tick cycle, only update squads assigned to that tick.
- refactored/added functions to handle squad AI with just the squad as the input to the function
