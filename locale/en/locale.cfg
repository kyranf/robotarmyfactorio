[item-description]
droid-rifle=Long range slow-reload rifle-equipped droid. Good in swarms.
droid-smg=Battle Droid, mounted with sub-machine gun.
droid-rocket=Rocket launcher equipped droid. Shoots slowly but stongly and from afar.
droid-flame=Flamethrower armed droid with a flame-resistant layer.
terminator=Most powerful battle droid. Almost unstoppable in groups.
defender-unit=Defender Robot Unit (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn.
distractor-unit=Distractor Robot Unit (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn.
destroyer-unit=Destroyer Robot Unit (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn.
droid-rifle-dummy=Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. Put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.
droid-smg-dummy=Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. Put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.
droid-rocket-dummy=Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. Put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.
droid-flame-dummy= Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. Put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.
terminator-dummy=Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. Put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.
defender-unit-dummy=Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.
distractor-unit-dummy=Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.
destroyer-unit-dummy=Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out.

droid-assembling-machine=Set the recipe to the type of droid to spawn, then insert the undeployed droid item and it will be spawned nearby and join/create a squad.
droid-guard-station=Droid Guard Station, spawns a squad which stay close to the station and act as guards. The station will maintain the squad size to a set amount and replace them as they die.
droid-counter=Constant combinator outputing the number of each type of deployed droids.
droid-settings=Set settings for your droid army by outputting signals.\nOnly one can be constructed.
loot-chest=Droid quads automatically collect alien artifacts for you, teleports them in the __ITEM__loot-chest__.
patrol-pole=Connect with green wires, make a chain of them along the patrol route. One end needs to be very close to a guard station. Then spawn a squad from the guard station (set up patrol route first!), squad will see patrol route and follow it.
droid-pickup-tool=drag a box around a bunch of friendly units to pick them up instantly.
droid-selection-tool=left click close to a squad to select (members will turn green when selected). shift-left-click to command to attack-move to that location. left click away from squad to deselect. Put it as icon on map to designate global attack target.
