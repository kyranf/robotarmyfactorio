droid-smg = Battle Droid (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
droid-smg-dummy = Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
droid-rocket = Rocket Droid (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
droid-rocket-dummy = Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
droid-rifle = Clockwork Riflebot (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
droid-rifle-dummy = Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
droid-assembling-machine = Droid Assembler, set the recipe to the type of droid to spawn, then insert the undeployed droid item and it will be spawned nearby and join/create a squad. 
terminator = Terminator, insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
terminator-dummy = Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
droid-counter = Droid Activity Module, counts how many droids of each type are alive in the map. use the signals to help control population count or spawn groups with ratios
loot-chest = Army Loot Chest, place this to allow your squads to automatically collect artifacts for you. they teleport them into this box. make sure to remove them before it gets full!
droid-guard-station = Droid Guard Station, spawns a squad which stay close to the station and act as guards. The station will maintain the squad size to a set amount and replace them as they die. 
rally-beacon = Droid Rally Beacon, only use in the rare occasions you have squads that get stuck or you want to bring all your squads in to one spot. DO NOT FORGOT ABOUT IT - it will stop your squads from functioning properly until it's removed
droid-flame = Flamebot (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
droid-flame-dummy =  Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
patrol-pole = Droid Patrol Post, link with green wires, make a chain of them along the patrol route. One end needs to be very close to a guard station. Then spawn a squad from the guard station (set up patrol route first!), squad will see patrol route and follow it.
droid-settings = Droid Settings Module, set the slots to virtual signals with the name of setting to adjust, change the values to whatever you want. Some values are not allowed. This affects the whole force. 
defender-unit = Defender Robot Unit (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
defender-unit-dummy =   Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
distractor-unit = Distractor Robot Unit (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
distractor-unit-dummy =  Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
destroyer-unit = Destroyer Robot Unit (undeployed), insert this to a droid assembler with recipe set to spawn this type or place on the ground to spawn. 
destroyer-unit-dummy =  Used as trigger to spawn unit near assembler. put this in the output of assembler to use it. Normally you don't want to take these out. 
droid-pickup-tool = drag a box around a bunch of friendly units to pick them up instantly.  
droid-selection-tool = left click close to a squad to select (members will turn green when selected). shift-left-click to command to attack-move to that location. left click away from squad to deselect.
