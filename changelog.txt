Version: 0.4.10
  Changes:
    - if unit control is active, don't run the runtime logic for assemblers squad management/merging/retreat and assembler-centric targetting, and don't run the squad logic at all. This should help in-progress games which add unit control halfway through.
    - added ai_settings to all droid units and flying units to try to prevent units from being deleted if they fail a command, and for them to attempt to spread out from eachother and not stack up.

Yay! Means I can get rid of the comment I had in the code, "-- ridiculous, we have to do parameters WHY WUBE WHY"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
