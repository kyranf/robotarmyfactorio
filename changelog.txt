Version: 0.4.10
  Changes:
    - if unit control is active, don't run the runtime logic for assemblers squad management/merging/retreat and assembler-centric targetting, and don't run the squad logic at all. This should help in-progress games which add unit control halfway through.

    - fixes to the Droid Counter module and the Settings Module code, which had issues with referencing parameters tables which have changed in recent history. instead of  control_behaviours.parameters.parameters, there's only one layer of parameters table now. Yay! Means I can get rid of the comment I had in the code, "-- ridiculous, we have to do parameters WHY WUBE WHY"
